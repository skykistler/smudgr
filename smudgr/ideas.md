various ideas
=============

+ Sort on different color channels
+ wordpad-type effect (find/replace)
+ seam carving glitching
+ delaunay (seam carve on delaunay?)
+ sort intervals converging on some center point with threshold diffusal (Gravity sort?)
+ map luma to color of one image and use it to re-color another image with that mapping (Image specific filters)
+ smear effect using directional sort and diffusing thresholds (Would look good on touch screens)
+ set the source to two images and interchange information (Not really sure what this entails)
+ seam-carving-esque algorithms that make use of "pixel walking"
+ Sort on lowest-energy or highest-energy walks from seam-carving(different ways of finding intervals to plug into Generic Pixel Sort)
+ randomly stretch and map stuff, broken nearest neighbor interpolation
+ Use animated GIF as source
