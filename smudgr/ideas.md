various ideas
=============

+ Sort on different color channels
+ seam carving glitching
+ delaunay
+ Use separate image for calculating an operation vs. committing it
+ smear effect using directional sort and diffusing thresholds (Would look good on touch screens)
+ seam-carving-esque algorithms that make use of "pixel walking"
+ Sort on lowest-energy or highest-energy walks from seam-carving(different ways of finding intervals to plug into Generic Pixel Sort)
+ randomly stretch and map stuff, broken nearest neighbor interpolation
