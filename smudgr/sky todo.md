Sometime soon
+ Generalized pixel sort using strategy pattern for different sort and threshold functions
+ Generalized marbeler using strategy for different interpolation functions
+ Reverse sort option
+ Toggle sorting rows or columns first
+ Nearest-neighbor upscale on save

Eric points
+ How should we generalize to stay compatible with radial sort
+ How were going to handle bounds
